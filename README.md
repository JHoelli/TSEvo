# TSEvo: Counterfactuals for Time Series Classification 
This repository contains the code to out paper "TSEvo: Counterfactuals for Time Series Classification" accepted at ICMLA '22.

With the increasing predominance of deep learning methods on time series classification, interpretability becomes essential, especially in high-stake scenarios. Although many approaches to interpretability have been explored for images and tabular data, time series data has been mostly neglected. We
approach the problem of interpretability by proposing TSEvo, a model-agnostic multiobjective evolutionary approach to time series counterfactuals incorporating a variety of time series transformation mechanisms to cope with different types and structures of time series.

TSEvo is now part of the soon-to-come release v0.0.14 of <a href="https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/TSInterpret">TSInterpret</a>(<a href="https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/TSInterpret/blob/main/docs/Notebooks/TSEvo_torch.ipynb">notebook </a>).
TSInterpret is a PyPi installable Python library to faciliate the usage of interpretability methods for times series classification and includes the counterfatuals methods used in the benchmark here as well as gradient based and perturbation based methods.

# Installation
To use TSEvo install:
```
pip install .
```
For rerunning the experiments, installing the requirements.txt is necessary.

# Usage
Entry point to TSEvo is ```CounterfactualExplanation.py```. 
```python
from TSEvo.CounterfactualExplanation import Explanation

model = # Your ML Model returning a probability distribution
data = #Additionally available in structure (x,y) 
backend= #'Torch' or 'Tensorflow'

exp = Explanation(model,data,backend)

original_x= # Data to explain
y= # Prediction to explain
target_y= # can be None
transformer= # choice of ['authentic_opposing_information','mutate_both','mutate_mean','frequency_band_mapping']

cf=ep.explain_instance(original_x,y, target_y= None,transformer = 'authentic_opposing_information')

```
